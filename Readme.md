# BEWARE

This is the hack I put together on a weekend to whack a pair of 5015 blowers
onto the tiny v0's carriage.

# What files are these? XML !?

It's only freecad project directories.
As in, you need to use the open directory option in the menu instead of the
open project option.

The cad/OG directory is the original hack.
The cad/NG directory is the prototype that makes the center bit into something
that might be possible to lazer cut out of alu.

# Special thanks
